City names:
Alcarann

Teckland?

Areas:
Dragonbone Catacombs
A place of powerful ancient magic. Created from dragon scholars pouring over
the corpses of dragons fueled by greed and the lust of power.

Intros:
The city ahead, Alcarann, is dangerous. It contains many unfortunate souls lost 
from the terrible war. The citizen's solace comes from their enchanted ruler, 
a magistrate seemingly blessed with godlike abilities. 

A tale is whispered around a town, a gang riding shadowy creatures roar through
the countryside and wooded towns at twilight, leaving an avalance of footprints
and destruction but no evidence of their whereabouts at daybreak.

In a secluded area of the magical isle, lives peaceful nomads who control the
local elements. They don't use artifacts or catalysts but instead master their
spirit to bend the natural world to their will. They contrast with the residing
wizards and warlocks crafting magical tools and weapons.
