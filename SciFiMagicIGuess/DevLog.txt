2/27/2020 Thursday 5th period flex - Josh
Club today! Hope they appreicate my progress.

Improved health bars, animation loads then on combat intro. Damage dealt to them
displays proportionally instead of just subtracting from 100. Animation can be
skiped in textSkip() method so an attack can deal damage instantly. 

Skill need to consider turn based functionality, considering a panel blocking
input for player in ActionButtons panel saying "enemy attacking" while enemy
attacks are calculated or randomized or whatever. 

I'll upload latest version 7th period to github, haven't done a repository update
for a while lol.

Working on game reconizing an enemy is dead.

Game reconizes enemy is dead. Health bar sends signal to AttackButtons saying an
enemy died. Added text functions to edit text log more effectively.

Fixed kicking the enemy while he's down, can't attack when enemy is dead. Just
takes player back to actionMenu. Now have two global booleans introOver and
skirmishOver to indicate the obvious. Working on intro music to wow club...



2/26/2020 Wednesday CSA (I AM playing a game I coded!) - Josh
Sent a screen recording through clickup of my custom texture progressbar, and 
the test animation of it changing values. Looked a little choppy, could just be
the duration or is it the step? IDK looking into it. I am also replacing the
player HP and MP with the custom bar.

Custom bar added for player HP and MP. Named the M mana after chris's suggestion
could be magic tho. 


2/25/2020 Tuesday PurdueClass (totally doing school work) - Josh
Just added method textSkip() in ActionButtons so I don't have to repeat all that
code. Not a big deal, but I am beginning to have concerns on having everything
run through the ActionButtons node. Oh well... Too far along now.

Going to start work on randomness for dealing damage, also:
thinking about having each physical weapon as an item that you have the option
of throwing at an enemy for a good chance at extra damage. A reason for doing it
is that your weapon could have a hidden durability with a sign on the attack
implying how much durability is left. I think that's cool, people would actually
buy daggers for their increased accuracy. But throwing a sword and making the 
mark would deal massive damage bro, yeah.

Randomn Attack function works, when writing (damage) dealt, I wondered about an
armour mechanic that would subtract a certain amount of damage from attacks. Both
the player and enemies can wear armour, with certain items able to destroy it.
Enough damage would destroy armour regardless.

Going to try to have enemy health bar respond to damage. Need UI workaround for
stats tab

Added critical hit feature that prints when max damage on a weapon is reached
Later at home I'm thinking about making my own custom progress bars that look 
much cooler then the defaults.

Sent out the call for more items and ideas in slack... hopefully they will answer

Got a nice purplish looking progress bar in there, will probably have to change
a lot of the textures to match the look of the game. I'm getting tired, think I
will chill on da bed. Might come back later today, might not.

Here we go

Script on each attack button not connects a signal when pressed to function in
ActionButtons, and! it transmit's it's own name. That means I can transmit my the
button object or anything I want in the button. Now the game knows which Attack
button you hit which is huge! Going to experiment with having dictonary spawn
attack buttons. 

Attempted uisng Godot Resources, very confusing. Kind of like a class in Java but
needs a script to interpret it I thing, usually used for much more complex data
structures. I think a dictonary with a key: moveName and an array with 2 values
minDamage and maxDamage.

just figured out how to run addMove method from AttackMenu script, good progress

Now I add attackMoves through ActionButtons script, still use function in 
MoveList so that script is still important. Going to make when you attack pop up
what you attacked on the log.

Moving to another quadrant!!

Log text is working nice. When an attack button is clicked, the log prints "Sir
John used his [attackname(item)]!" and then a new line is used for each. Glad that
\n works. Going to help friend with Calc, so bye lol



2/23/20 Sunday Afternoon - Josh
A new day awaits

Just added scroll container in attackMenu and an AttackMove scene that is just
the button. Have a method in MoveList script that adds attacks now, probably 
will work with a move dictonary like the dict planned for items. 

Showed my screenshots with some friends, not terribly interested. At least not 
yet. >:) 

Going to begin work on...
Attack functionality, why not. Guess a dictonary needs to be put in now lol

Realized that I need to do other homework. Will come back to it, MoveList still
needs some work. Can't correctly connect signal 'pressed' for the attack move
with another function that can get me the properties of the button, like it's
name. Ugh.
 


2/22/20 Saturday Morning - Josh
Decided to make a dev log to track my thoughts, the game is getting big enough
that I think having notes would be handy. 

I have already successfully implemented the title sequence (or at least a test
version) with my own working title, 'SciFi Magic I Guess...' Dylan and Aaron
are trying to think of an actual name. I'm more concerned with the functionality
Oh Dylan said he's almost done with some character creation which should be
interesting. That would help establish some story points and from that a title, 
plot, whole point of the game maybe. 

What I am working on is the Attack menu, the list of moves that would pop up
when the 'Attack' button is clicked. Took me longer than I liked to figure out
how I could do that cleanly in Godot... viewports didn't work, hiding elements
and showing them would but is annoying, but the best option I've found is having
a new scene rendered specifically for the attack menu, and have it spawn from a 
certain 2Dnode. (I named it spawner, duh) So, when I figure out how to use all
these control nodes correctly like margin containers and Vboxes to get the moves
to display how I want them too... I can then make variations of that model for
the magic and item buttons. 

A couple concerns I have, I need to have a script
create each action instead of me just type in every move. Also items would 
especially need a scroll bar functionality to it, and I think each action needs
a little description with it... that would be complicated with the current 
layout. Right now the 'sword', 'fist', text is big which I like. Maybe when you
hover over a button it expands and you see the description? That sounds really
difficult right now but it's a thought. 

Also about this file: I'm fine with people adding to it with their updates and 
thoughts about the game, but don't delete anything, and title your entry like I
did. Ofc I probably don't need to worry, I've been the only one working on this
game for a while ;)

2 Hours later...

Oh my gosh finally figured out how to do the bare minimum of switching through
scene instances for the action menu. So basically, I'm going to load each submenu
(AttackMenu, MagicMenu, ItemMenu) into my ActionButtons object. ActionButtons 
has a child node named ActionMenu which i hide whenever I switch to another menu.
All of the submenus I mentioned earlier are hidden when they are added into the
scene. Each submenu will start with a <- Back button that emits a signal to the
AttackButtons object, that will hide the current submenu and bring back the 
ActionMenu, the main menu. If it's confusing for you it certainly was confusing
for me, It took me so long to figure out how to get that signal from the Back
button to connect to the object, I just needed to be more specific with my
get_node() method. You can see it in ActionButtons.gd. I haven't made another
scene for magic and items, I'm hoping I can come up with a script that can make
spawning the buttons easier to dynamically change your possible actions in the 
game. Especially want to figure out a scroll bar thing for items.

Make sure to have the text label for buttons show stats, unless that info is 
moved in a different place later in development. I really want lunch.

Came back from Qdoba feeling refreshed. Going to start work on item/magic scenes

Hey I'm thinking the magic could look different from attack actions, it could
have more of a grid like matrix with an icon for the spell and show mana cost.
The items would look more like the attack actions, but I'm thinking skinnier
button bars with an x6 showing how much of that item there is. Maybe not have
an x1 but start at x2. I'm going to start item menu scene. 

Status on item scene, I have a ItemMenu that will spawn Item scenes. Still need
to work out how to edit the text on each button for each scene that I spawn, but
the good news is I'm getting better at the control nodes for UI. The temp list
spawned 10 items that look decent on a panel background. More impressively, I
changed the buttons for ActionMenu to use v split and H split for the 4 buttons.
Looking back, I could have used an h and vbox container, but it's whatever. 
The buttons have min sizes and are centered in each corner with a nice margin 
container preserving the edges. It may look rediculous in the node tree, but I
got the hang of it. I have a nice grasp on GODOT control nodes for UI now. :)

Going to start work on item button access....

Item list spawn works. Had to fiddle for a while with margin containers, which 
work a lot better than center containers. Also, I didn't use HSplits, Hboxes
always seem to work better. Item menu has the panel and scroll container for 
all the items in the list, but doesn't have any. The items are spawned in from
the Item scene. A button with two labels, one label with the item name and 
quantity. The other with a discription. Took a lot of fiddling to get the desc
to be how I wanted it, shouldn't have started with a rich text box. Now the 
tricky part I've been putting off, to get the signal from each button in the list
so it will do stuff in the combat scene. I'm trying to go baby mode right now, 
just have the first button '<- back' work to go back to actionMenu. Need probably
a dictonary to feed to list creation so I have reference in combat scene, ugh. 

Good news tho, list menu can dynamically grow thanks to a function in the list
script. I did what I set out to do! But getting button signals will be annoying. 

Yessss finally got it!! Now the back 'item' connects it's pressed signal to the
"backToActionMenu" function I've already written, so it works fine! This node
structure can get confusing when you're changing where objects are on the tree,
especially in this case when I was 2 scripted objects in... my saving grace was
this get_owner() method that brought me to the top Node2D of ItemMenu, then a
step back and I was right in the script I needed to be. Awe yes! 

Now I can either begin working on magicMenu, a dictionary for items,
attack functionality, or a world map. I'm done for the day... I'll upload to
GitHub and then enjoy some YouTube. Good Progress!!!
